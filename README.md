# JIRA Agent - User Stories to JIRA Epics

A local agent that reads user stories from a text file and automatically creates corresponding epics and stories in JIRA using the JIRA REST API.

## Features

- üìñ **Smart Parser**: Parses structured user stories from text files
- üéØ **Epic Organization**: Automatically groups stories into epics
- üîÑ **Priority & Story Points**: Supports priority levels and story point estimation
- üîó **JIRA Integration**: Creates epics and stories with proper linking
- üõ†Ô∏è **Flexible Configuration**: YAML config files or environment variables
- üîç **Dry Run Mode**: Preview what will be created without making changes
- ‚úÖ **Validation**: Built-in validation for configuration and user stories

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone or download the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd jira-agent

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Setup Configuration

Run the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
python jira_agent.py setup
```

Or manually create configuration:

**Option A: Create `config.yaml`**
```yaml
jira:
  server: "https://your-domain.atlassian.net"
  username: "your-email@example.com"
  api_token: "your-api-token"
  project_key: "PROJ"

stories:
  input_file: "user_stories.txt"
  epic_name_prefix: "Epic: "
  story_type: "Story"
  epic_type: "Epic"
```

**Option B: Create `.env` file**
```bash
JIRA_SERVER=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
JIRA_USERNAME=your-email@example.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=PROJ
```

### 3. Create User Stories File

Create a `user_stories.txt` file with your user stories:

```text
EPIC: User Authentication System
- As a user, I want to register with email and password so that I can create an account [High] {5}
- As a user, I want to login with my credentials so that I can access the application [High] {3}
- As a user, I want to reset my password if I forget it so that I can regain access [Medium] {3}

EPIC: Product Catalog Management
- As a customer, I want to browse products by category so that I can find what I need [High] {5}
- As a customer, I want to search for products by name so that I can quickly locate items [High] {8}
```

### 4. Test and Run

```bash
# Test JIRA connection
python jira_agent.py test

# Parse and validate user stories (dry run)
python jira_agent.py parse

# Create epics and stories in JIRA
python jira_agent.py create
```

## User Stories Format

The user stories file uses a simple, structured format:

```text
# Comments start with #
# Each epic starts with "EPIC:" followed by the epic name
# Stories are listed with "-" and can include priority and story points

EPIC: Epic Name Here
- As a [role], I want to [action] so that [benefit] [Priority] {Story Points}
- As a user, I want to login so that I can access my account [High] {3}
- As an admin, I want to manage users so that I can maintain security [Medium] {5}

EPIC: Another Epic
- Story without priority or points
- Story with priority only [Low]
- Story with story points only {8}
```

### Supported Elements

- **Epic Name**: Any text after `EPIC:`
- **Priority Levels**: `[High]`, `[Medium]`, `[Low]`, `[Critical]`, `[Blocker]`
- **Story Points**: Numbers in curly braces `{1}`, `{2}`, `{3}`, `{5}`, `{8}`, `{13}`, etc.
- **Comments**: Lines starting with `#` are ignored

## Commands

### `create` - Create JIRA Issues

Creates epics and stories in JIRA from the user stories file.

```bash
python jira_agent.py create [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -c, --config FILE        Configuration file path (default: config.yaml)
  -i, --input-file FILE    User stories input file (overrides config)
  -d, --dry-run           Parse stories but don't create JIRA issues
  -v, --verbose           Verbose output
```

Examples:
```bash
# Basic usage
python jira_agent.py create

# Use custom config file
python jira_agent.py create --config custom-config.yaml

# Use different input file
python jira_agent.py create --input-file my-stories.txt

# Dry run to see what would be created
python jira_agent.py create --dry-run

# Verbose output with detailed information
python jira_agent.py create --verbose
```

### `test` - Test Configuration

Tests JIRA connection and displays project information.

```bash
python jira_agent.py test [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -c, --config FILE        Configuration file path (default: config.yaml)
```

### `parse` - Parse User Stories

Parses and validates the user stories file without connecting to JIRA.

```bash
python jira_agent.py parse [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -i, --input-file FILE    User stories file to parse (default: user_stories.txt)
```

### `setup` - Interactive Setup

Interactive wizard to create configuration files.

```bash
python jira_agent.py setup
```

## JIRA Setup

### 1. Get API Token

1. Go to [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Give it a label and copy the token
4. Use this token in your configuration

### 2. Find Project Key

1. Go to your JIRA project
2. Look at the URL or project settings
3. The project key is usually 2-4 uppercase letters (e.g., "PROJ", "DEV", "TEAM")

### 3. Required Permissions

Your JIRA user needs permissions to:
- Create issues in the target project
- Create epics (if your project supports them)
- Link issues (for epic-story relationships)

## Configuration

### Configuration Precedence

1. Environment variables (highest priority)
2. Configuration file (YAML)
3. Default values (lowest priority)

### Environment Variables

- `JIRA_SERVER` - JIRA server URL
- `JIRA_USERNAME` - JIRA username (email)
- `JIRA_API_TOKEN` - JIRA API token
- `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY` - JIRA project key

### Custom Field IDs

JIRA custom fields may have different IDs in your instance. You can modify these in `jira_client.py`:

```python
# Epic Name field (common IDs: customfield_10011, customfield_10004)
epic_fields['customfield_10011'] = epic.title

# Story Points field (common IDs: customfield_10016, customfield_10002)
story_fields['customfield_10016'] = story.story_points
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Verify your API token is correct
   - Check that your username is your email address
   - Ensure your JIRA server URL is correct

2. **Permission Denied**
   - Verify you have permission to create issues in the project
   - Check if Epic issue type is available in your project

3. **Custom Field Errors**
   - Epic Name or Story Points fields may have different IDs
   - Modify the field IDs in `jira_client.py`

4. **Issue Type Not Found**
   - Verify "Epic" and "Story" issue types exist in your project
   - Check project configuration in JIRA

### Getting Help

1. Run with `--verbose` for detailed output
2. Use `python jira_agent.py test` to verify configuration
3. Use `python jira_agent.py parse` to validate user stories format
