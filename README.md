## Supported File Formats

### 1. Plain Text (.txt, .md)
Stories separated by empty lines or dividers:

```
User Login Feature
As a user, I want to log into the system so that I can access my account.

Acceptance Criteria:
- User can enter email and password

- User is redirected to dashboard on success

---

Password Reset
As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account.

AC:
- User can request password reset via email
- Reset link expires after 24 hours
```

### 2. JSON (.json)
Structured format for precise control:

```json
{
  "stories": [
    {
      "title": "User Login Feature",
      "description": "As a user, I want to log into the system so that I can access my account.",
      "acceptanceCriteria": "- User can enter email and password\n- System validates credentials\n- User is redirected to dashboard on success"
    },
    {
      "title": "Password Reset",
      "description": "As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account.",
      "acceptanceCriteria": "- User can request password reset via email\n- Reset link expires after 24 hours"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. CSV (.csv)

## Usage Workflow

1. **Upload File**: Drag and drop or select your user stories file
2. **Parse Stories**: Review the automatically parsed stories
3. **Edit (Optional)**: Use the built-in editor to modify stories
4. **Select Project**: Choose your JIRA project from the dropdown
5. **Select Epic (Optional)**: Choose an epic to organize your stories
6. **Create Stories**: Bulk create all stories in JIRA
7. **Review Results**: See which stories were created successfully

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/projects` - Fetch available JIRA projects
- `GET /api/projects/:projectKey/epics` - Fetch epics for a project
- `POST /api/parse-stories` - Parse user stories from uploaded file
- `POST /api/create-stories` - Create user stories in JIRA

## File Parsing Logic

### Text Files
- Stories separated by empty lines or horizontal rules (`---`, `===`)
- First line becomes the title if it's short (<100 chars) or starts with `#`, `Title:`, `Story:`
- Acceptance criteria detected with keywords: "Acceptance Criteria", "AC"

### JSON Files
- Supports array of story objects or `{stories: [...]}` wrapper
- Maps `title/summary`, `description/details`, `acceptanceCriteria/acceptance`

### CSV Files
- Header row required
- Auto-detects columns containing "title", "description", "acceptance", etc.
- Flexible column ordering

## Error Handling

- **File Validation**: Only accepted file types allowed
- **JIRA Connection**: Clear error messages for authentication issues
- **Story Creation**: Individual story failures don't stop the batch
- **Detailed Feedback**: Complete results with success/failure details

## Development

```bash
# Development mode with auto-restart
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

## Dependencies

- **Express**: Web server framework
- **Multer**: File upload handling
- **Axios**: HTTP client for JIRA API
- **CORS**: Cross-origin request support
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management

## Security Notes

- API tokens are stored in environment variables
- File uploads are validated and cleaned up
- No persistent file storage
- Basic authentication for JIRA API

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to load JIRA projects"**
   - Check your JIRA base URL format: `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`
   - Verify your email and API token are correct
   - Ensure the API token has proper permissions

2. **"Story issue type not found"**
   - Your JIRA project must have a "Story" or "User Story" issue type
   - Check your project configuration in JIRA

3. **"No stories found in file"**
   - Check file format matches expected patterns
   - Ensure proper separation between stories in text files
   - Verify JSON structure for JSON files

### File Format Tips

- **Text files**: Use empty lines or `---` to separate stories
- **JSON files**: Use consistent field names (`title`, `description`, `acceptanceCriteria`)
- **CSV files**: Include headers and use commas as separators
- **All formats**: Keep titles concise and descriptions clear
